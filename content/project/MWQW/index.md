We use computer to simulate quantum walks in optical systems. Our new walking protocol lead us to some intresting features that might never observed from previous studies. We then use schrödinger’s approach to explain this feature. Some characteristics in quantum walks were also discissed in our work, including exit probabilities, dispersion entries, and the recurrence relations. In the future, we will implent this work in optical lattice and find its applications in sesitive measutements. You can see all our results once we summit our works in the end of Dec 2020!
