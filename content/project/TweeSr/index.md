Quantum Simulators can be built by atomic tweezer arrays. Neutral atoms in optical dipole traps allowing us to access high-fidelity creation and detection in the quantum information processing. Atoms can be easily relocated into different lattices to simulate interesting quantum phenomenons that is difficult to accuratly obtain even through high proformance computing techniques.

What I have implemented:

* Developing algorithms for atom resorting when initial loading atoms into optical dipole traps.

* Constructing a multiplexing laser‑optics system with stable PID control backend and sharp user‑interface frontend.
