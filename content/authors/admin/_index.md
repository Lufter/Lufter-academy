The Shire once raised some valiant hearts, who seek to carry the burden and preserve their beloving world. I wish to have this courage in my future expedition to the temple of quantum science.

I recieved my B.S. degree in [Civil Engineering department](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en), National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. I worked on my undergraduate research in [Physics department](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/2012/en/) [MatterwaveLab](https://thelm2005.wixsite.com/website) with [Prof. Pei-Chen, Kuan](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/db/pweb/teacher.php?user_id=170222) and AI MaterialLab with [Prof. Yun-Che, Wang](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~yunche/).
