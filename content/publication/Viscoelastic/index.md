abstract: People are always wondering to have a clear path that, whether we can design the mechanical properties we desire under some boundary conditions. Auxetic materials with recessed geometry were belived result in the property of negative poisson's ratio. Things like disorder networks and hexagon-inspired geometry has already being studies for decades with delightful performance. In this paper, thirty thousands 32 by 32 bits binary microstructure interpreted auxetic samples were generated by random algorithm and brownian based algorithm. These samples were then labeled by finite element method, with adequent parameters to describe the mechanical properties of the sample material. Our machine learning model is based on a VGG19, an image classification model, but reconstructed as a regression version. Classification and regression problems were the fundamental classes of problems that computer scientist buried into. Luckily, their attributes now bloomed as the progress in technology. Today we deem our design problem to further demonstrate later more like a regression problem essentially. If we already have some random generated samples and their material property labels, and we hope that the pump them into an oracle machine then it comes out with its prophecy or predicted labels. The oracle is now known as neural networks. It is the spirit of most algorithms in image recognition. For the problems in the image recognition realm, the most important thing is that convolutional neural networks(CNN) are assembled from convolution and pooling layers to extract features from the input data or the previous layers, for our problem, images. The output layers can be modified regard to categories of the problem we are curious about. A proper loss function and optimizer is critical for the machine learning model to reach its solutions. Machine learning models are intend to be more efficient than conventional algorithms under the same amount of computation cost. Consider the case of the  optimization of a material design problem, if we are trying to design a two dimensional microstructure inside a N by N matrix M. In the worst case of infinite searching algorithm, we need to conduct 2^{N \times N} times of evaluation. In order to describe the material with accuracy, usually more than P parameters must be measured. And traditionally, finite element methods are computationally expensive. Luckily, machine learning algorithms are supposed to  allow us to use FEM only once on relatively small amount of samples in the matrix to predict the entire set of possibilities. We hope to apply this method to the design of viscoelastic auxetic materials, or High damping and high stiffness (HDHS) materials.
