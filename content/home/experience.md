  Multiple Way Quantum Walk (MWQW):
    * Discussed the error tolerance when implementing MWQW in optical systems by using analytical and numerical methods.

    * Deployed a computer program that simulates and visualizes MWQW, which enhanced our working efficiency.

    * Improved the defects in previous asymptotic analysis methods when implementing Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs approach to MWQW.

    * Presented the recursive relations in MWQW and its exit probability ùëù‚àû from an automation perspective.

  Sensitive Measurements Through Matter Waves

    * Research on implementing double‚Äëdiffraction Bloch oscillation to cancel the phase perterbation when performing sensitive measurements.

  Machine Learning in Material Design. [APCOM2019] [CTAM2020]

    * Applied generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate high fidelity microstructure images.

    * Proposed regression VGG networks (rVGG) that can predict mechanical properties from material images with 95% accuracy.

    * Outperformed Finite Element Methods (FEM) in predicting time over 100 times.

    * Investigated an Bayesian‚Äëoptimization model that can fine‚Äëtune GAN‚Äëgenerated microstructure geometry through the raid labeling of rVGG.

  Construcrting Homogenous Materials Using Vomputational Methods.
    
    * Implemented pruning protocol on 96 core CPUs to generate auxetic networks inspired by [Auxetic metamaterials from disordered networks](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/7/E1384)

    * Implemented a stochastic protocol to produce large scale homogenous microstructure datasets by two‚Äëpoint correlation function.
