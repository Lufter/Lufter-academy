title: Design of Viscoelastic Auxetic Materials Through Machine Deep Learning 
event: Asian Pacific Congresson Computational Mechanics (APCOM2019) 
event_url: http://www.apcom2019.org/

location: Taipei International Convention Center
address:
  street: 1 Hsin-Yi Road,Section 5
  city: Taipei
  region: TW
  postcode: '11049'
  country: Taiwan ROC

summary: Discussed the use of VGG networks as an alternative of Finite Element Methods (FEM) when labeling mechanical properties of small size 2D microstructure geometries.
abstract: "The investigation of optimizing and design a material is usually computational expensive. We are presenting a machine learning method, mostly image recognition and regression, to avoid the handicap under a large-scale design problem."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
